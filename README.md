Implementation of CPU Scheduling Algorithms Using Linked List Data Structures

In various computer contexts, job scheduling algorithms are essential for maximizing system throughput and optimizing resource utilization. This work uses linked lists as a basic data structure to give a visual implementation of job scheduling algorithms. Understanding the working and performance of well-known scheduling algorithms including First Come First Serve (FCFS), Priority Scheduling (non-preemptive), Round Robin (RR), and Shortest Job First (SJF) is made easier with the help of this software which offers an approachable and interactive platform. Users may view the dynamic distribution of CPU time across several processes, which are represented as nodes in a linked list, using an intuitive interface. Additionally, the Gantt chart representation is simplified. Process ID, arrival time, burst time, priority, and time quantum (TQ) constitute some inputs that the user can provide.
